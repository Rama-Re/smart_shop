This project is an AI-powered smart shopping platform that utilizes facial recognition and emotion detection to create a personalized e-commerce experience. Users can sign in and simulate payments using face-based authentication. The system analyzes the user's age, gender, and emotional state through facial analysis to recommend suitable products.

## Key Features
1. Face-based authentication for login and payment simulation
2. Emotion, age, and gender detection using DeepFace
3. Personalized product recommendations based on emotional and demographic insights
4. Product similarity engine using NLP-based text comparison
5. Digital wallet system for simulating transactions
6. Shopping cart and checkout system
Role-based access for different user types (e.g., normal user, admin)

## Tech Stack

1. Backend: Django, MySQL, JWT
2. Frontend: Flutter
3. AI/ML Libraries: DeepFace, OpenCV, scikit-learn
4. Other Tools: Natural Language Processing for text similarity
